For your 3-day romantic beach vacation in Vietnam, I recommend **Ha Long Bay** (ID: `city_ha_long`) as the top choice. While Da Lat (ID: `city_da_lat`) is explicitly described as "romantic" and has a high relevance score, it is a mountain destination, not a beach one, making it unsuitable for your specific request. Ha Long Bay, on the other hand, perfectly combines stunning natural beauty, beach access, and unique romantic experiences.

Here's a detailed plan and recommendations:

---

### **Recommended Destination: Ha Long Bay (ID: `city_ha_long`)**

Ha Long Bay is renowned for its emerald waters and thousands of towering limestone islands topped with rainforests. A luxury cruise here offers an incredibly romantic and unique beach-adjacent experience, perfect for a 3-day getaway.

**Why Ha Long Bay for a Romantic Beach Vacation?**
*   **Romantic Ambiance:** The breathtaking scenery, serene waters, and opportunity for private moments on a cruise create an inherently romantic atmosphere.
*   **Beach & Nature:** It offers beautiful beaches on various islands, alongside unique nature experiences like cave exploration and kayaking.
*   **Cruise Experience:** Overnight cruises are a highlight, providing luxury accommodation, gourmet dining, and activities all within the stunning bay. This aligns well with `activity_65` (boat rides), which is central to the Ha Long Bay experience.
*   **Authentic Experiences:** Combines local culture and food, as mentioned in its description.

---

### **3-Day Romantic Ha Long Bay Itinerary**

This itinerary focuses on maximizing relaxation and romantic experiences within the 3-day timeframe, minimizing travel stress.     

**Day 1: Arrival & Romantic Cruise Embarkation**
*   **Morning/Afternoon:** Arrive at Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport (ID: `city_hanoi`). From there, take a pre-arranged luxury shuttle or private car transfer to Ha Long Bay (approximately 2.5-3 hours).
*   **Late Afternoon:** Board your chosen luxury overnight cruise. Many cruises offer welcome drinks and a briefing as you set sail into the magnificent bay.
*   **Evening:** Enjoy a gourmet dinner with your partner, often featuring fresh seafood, while watching the sunset over the karsts. Participate in an evening activity like squid fishing or simply relax on the deck under the stars.

**Day 2: Bay Exploration & Intimate Moments**
*   **Morning:** Start your day with Tai Chi on the sundeck or simply enjoy the sunrise views. After breakfast, the cruise will take you to explore some of Ha Long Bay's iconic attractions.
    *   **Activity Suggestion:** Visit a stunning cave (e.g., Sung Sot Cave) or enjoy kayaking through hidden lagoons and around limestone islets (`activity_65`). This offers a chance for intimate exploration.
*   **Afternoon:** Enjoy lunch back on board. The cruise will continue to a secluded beach area where you can swim, sunbathe, or simply relax together.
*   **Evening:** Indulge in another exquisite dinner. Some cruises offer a cooking class (`activity_64`) where you can learn to make traditional Vietnamese dishes together, adding a fun and romantic element to your evening.

**Day 3: Farewell Ha Long & Departure**
*   **Morning:** Enjoy a final breakfast or brunch on board as the cruise slowly makes its way back to the harbor. You might have one last opportunity for a short activity like visiting a floating village or a final swim.
*   **Late Morning:** Disembark from your cruise.
*   **Afternoon:** Transfer back to Hanoi for your onward flight, carrying beautiful memories of your romantic escape.

---

### **Alternative Consideration: Da Nang (ID: `city_da_nang`)**

If you prefer a more active beach vacation with modern amenities and direct beach access from a city, Da Nang is a strong alternative.
*   **Pros:** Known for its beautiful long sandy beaches (like My Khe Beach), modern infrastructure, and proximity to other attractions like Hoi An (ID: `city_hoi_an`).
*   **Cons:** While it has beaches, it might offer a less uniquely "romantic" experience compared to the serene and iconic landscape of Ha Long Bay's cruise. For a 3-day trip, flying to Central Vietnam (Da Nang) might take more travel time than flying to Hanoi and transferring to Ha Long Bay, depending on your starting point.

---

### **Important Note on Da Lat (ID: `city_da_lat`)**

While Da Lat is highly relevant for "romantic" experiences and "flowers," it is a mountain city in Southern Vietnam, not a beach destination. Therefore, it does not fit your request for a "romantic beach vacation."

---

Enjoy your romantic getaway in Vietnam!

Based on your request for a city in Vietnam that offers both mountains and beaches, **Ha Long Bay** is your ideal destination.     

While Da Lat and Sapa are excellent choices for mountain lovers, they do not offer beaches. Ha Long Bay, on the other hand, perfectly combines stunning mountainous landscapes (in the form of its iconic limestone karsts rising from the sea) with beautiful beaches.

Here's why Ha Long Bay is the perfect fit and what you can expect:

**Ha Long Bay (City)**
*   **Mountains:** The defining feature of Ha Long Bay is its thousands of towering limestone karsts and islets. These dramatic formations create a majestic, mountainous seascape that is truly unique and offers incredible views.
*   **Beaches:** The bay is dotted with numerous pristine beaches on its islands, perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and kayaking.  
*   **Activities:** Cruising through the bay, exploring caves, kayaking around islets, and relaxing on secluded beaches are popular activities.
*   **Relevant Attractions:**
    *   **attraction_43:** Described as "A popular attraction in Ha Long Bay known for its cultural and scenic beauty. Perfect for tourists who love beach." This directly addresses your interest in beaches.
    *   **attraction_47:** Also located in Ha Long Bay, suggesting more points of interest within the area.

**Practical Logistics:**
Ha Long Bay is located in northern Vietnam. The most common way to access Ha Long Bay is by traveling from Hanoi (approximately 2-3 hours by car/bus). While the provided graph shows connections from Ho Chi Minh City to Sapa and Mekong Delta, it does not directly show connections to Ha Long Bay. If you are starting your trip from Ho Chi Minh City, you would typically fly to Hanoi first and then arrange transport to Ha Long Bay.

**Recommendation:**
Plan your trip to **Ha Long Bay (City)**. You'll be able to experience the breathtaking "mountains" of the limestone karsts and enjoy the beautiful beaches within the same stunning location.

    *   **Long Bien Bridge:** Walk or bike across this historic bridge for great views of the Red River.
3.  **Transportation:**
    *   **Walking:** The Old Quarter and areas around Hoan Kiem Lake are best explored on foot.
    *   **Local Buses:** An incredibly cheap way to get around the city, though it might require some navigation.
    *   **Grab (Ride-Hailing App):** Use Grab for motorbikes (GrabBike) or cars (GrabCar) for convenient and transparent pricing. It's often cheaper than traditional taxis.
4.  **Shopping:** Bargain respectfully at markets like Dong Xuan Market for souvenirs, clothing, and local goods.

By choosing budget-friendly accommodation like Hanoi Hotel 23 and embracing the local way of life, you can have an incredible and affordable trip to Hanoi!

For a 3-day romantic beach vacation in Vietnam, the key is to choose a destination that combines beautiful coastal scenery with a romantic atmosphere, while also being logistically feasible for a short trip.

Based on your query and the provided data, here are the top recommendations:

### Analysis of Your Request & Data:

*   **User Goal:** 3-day romantic beach vacation.
*   **Key Descriptors:** "Romantic," "Beach," "3 days" (implies minimal travel time between locations).
*   **Strong Semantic Matches for "Beach" & "Romantic":**
    *   **Ha Long Bay (city_ha_long):** Explicitly mentions "beach, cruise, nature experiences" and is often considered romantic, especially with overnight cruises.
    *   **Da Nang (city_da_nang):** Explicitly mentions "beach, modern." While "modern" isn't directly "romantic," its proximity to Hoi An makes it a strong contender.
    *   **Da Lat (city_da_lat):** Explicitly mentions "romantic, flowers, mountain." While highly romantic, it is *not* a beach destination, so it doesn't fit the "beach" criteria.
*   **Relevant Activities:** Ha Long Bay Activity 65 (boat rides) is highly relevant for a romantic cruise experience.
*   **Graph Relationships:** `city_ha_long` has many attractions and a hotel, confirming it's a developed tourist destination. `city_ha_long` is also connected to `Hoi An` (city_hoi_an), which is known for its romantic charm, although geographically distant from Ha Long Bay itself.

### Recommendations:

Considering the "romantic beach" criteria and the 3-day constraint, I recommend two primary options, each offering a distinct romantic beach experience:

---

### Option 1: Ha Long Bay - The Romantic Cruise Escape

**Why it's perfect:** Ha Long Bay offers a unique "beach" experience through its iconic limestone karsts, emerald waters, and luxurious overnight cruises. It's incredibly scenic and inherently romantic.

*   **Location:** Northern Vietnam (city_ha_long)
*   **Romantic Appeal:** Stunning natural beauty, private balconies on cruises, sunset dinners on deck, kayaking in secluded lagoons.
*   **Beach Aspect:** While not a traditional long sandy beach, you can swim, kayak, and relax on small, pristine beaches accessible by boat.
*   **Logistics:** Fly into Hanoi (city_hanoi), then a comfortable 2-3 hour transfer to Ha Long Bay.

**Sample 3-Day Itinerary:**

*   **Day 1: Arrival & Overnight Cruise Immersion**
    *   Morning: Arrive at Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport (city_hanoi). Take a pre-arranged shuttle or private car transfer to Ha Long Bay (approx. 2.5-3 hours).
    *   Afternoon: Board your chosen luxury overnight cruise (e.g., Ha Long Bay Hotel 51 or similar). Settle into your cabin, enjoy a welcome drink and lunch as the boat begins its journey through the stunning karsts.
    *   Evening: Enjoy activities like kayaking (activity_65), swimming, or visiting a cave. Indulge in a romantic dinner on board, perhaps followed by squid fishing or simply stargazing from your deck.
*   **Day 2: Bay Exploration & Relaxation**
    *   Morning: Wake up to the serene beauty of the bay. Participate in a Tai Chi session on deck. Enjoy breakfast. Continue exploring the bay, perhaps visiting a floating village or another cave.
    *   Afternoon: Relax on the sundeck, enjoy the views, or take another swim. Some cruises offer cooking classes.
    *   Evening: Another exquisite dinner on board, perhaps with a special romantic setup or a private dining experience.
*   **Day 3: Farewell Ha Long & Departure**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a final breakfast on the cruise. The boat will slowly make its way back to the harbor. Disembark and transfer back to Hanoi (city_hanoi) for your onward flight.

### Option 2: Da Nang & Hoi An - Classic Beach & Charming Town Romance

**Why it's perfect:** This option combines the beautiful sandy beaches of Da Nang with the enchanting, lantern-lit ancient town of Hoi An, offering a blend of relaxation and cultural romance.

*   **Location:** Central Vietnam (city_da_nang, city_hoi_an)
*   **Romantic Appeal:** Long sandy beaches, charming ancient town with lanterns, riverside dining, tailor-made clothes, cooking classes.
*   **Beach Aspect:** Da Nang boasts stunning My Khe Beach, perfect for sunbathing, swimming, and watersports. Hoi An also has nearby beaches like An Bang.
*   **Logistics:** Fly directly into Da Nang International Airport (city_da_nang). Hoi An (city_hoi_an) is a short 30-45 minute drive away.

**Sample 3-Day Itinerary:**

*   **Day 1: Da Nang Beach Bliss**
    *   Morning: Arrive at Da Nang International Airport (city_da_nang). Transfer to your beachfront resort in Da Nang.
    *   Afternoon: Relax on the pristine sands of My Khe Beach. Enjoy swimming, sunbathing, or a romantic stroll along the shore.  
    *   Evening: Indulge in a fresh seafood dinner at a beachfront restaurant in Da Nang.
*   **Day 2: Hoi An Ancient Town Romance**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a leisurely breakfast at your resort. Spend the morning relaxing on the beach or by the pool.
    *   Afternoon: Take a short transfer (30-45 mins) to Hoi An (city_hoi_an). Check into a charming boutique hotel in or near the ancient town. Explore the UNESCO World Heritage site, visit the Japanese Covered Bridge, and browse the tailor shops.
    *   Evening: Experience the magical lantern-lit streets of Hoi An. Enjoy a romantic dinner at a riverside restaurant, followed by a traditional lantern boat ride on the Thu Bon River.
*   **Day 3: Hoi An Charm & Departure**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a leisurely breakfast in Hoi An. Perhaps take a cooking class together, cycle through the rice paddies, or simply enjoy a coffee by the river.
    *   Afternoon: Do some last-minute souvenir shopping or get a custom outfit made.
    *   Late Afternoon: Transfer back to Da Nang International Airport (city_da_nang) for your departure.

---

### Other Considerations:

*   **Da Lat (city_da_lat):** While highly rated for "romantic" and "flowers," Da Lat is a mountain city in Southern Vietnam and does not offer a beach experience. It's a fantastic romantic destination, but not for a *beach* vacation.
*   **Hanoi (city_hanoi):** A vibrant capital known for culture and food, but not a beach destination. It serves as a gateway for Ha Long Bay.

For a 3-day romantic beach vacation, both Ha Long Bay and the Da Nang/Hoi An combination offer incredible experiences. Choose Ha Long Bay for a unique, scenic cruise adventure, or Da Nang/Hoi An for a blend of classic sandy beaches and charming cultural romance.

## 🛠️ Technical Design

### 1. Embedding Strategy

**Choice:** Sentence-Transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

**Rationale:**
- FREE (runs locally)
- Fast (384-dim vectors)
- Good semantic understanding
- No API rate limits

**Performance:**
- 50 embeddings/sec on CPU
- 200 embeddings/sec on GPU
- 150MB model size (cached)

### 2. RRF Fusion Algorithm

**Formula:**
```
score(doc_i) = Σ [1 / (k + rank_vec)] + Σ [1 / (k + rank_graph)]
```

**Parameters:**
- `k = 60` (standard RRF constant)
- Weights: Equal (1.0 each source)

**Why RRF?**
- Source-agnostic (no score normalization needed)
- Robust to outliers
- Used in production (Elasticsearch, Vespa)

### 3. Neo4j Schema

**Node Labels:**
```cypher
(:City {id, name, region, description, tags})
(:Attraction {id, name, type, city, description})
(:Hotel {id, name, stars, price_range, city})
(:Activity {id, name, category, duration, cost})
```

**Relationships:**
```cypher
(City)-[:Located_In]->(Attraction)
(City)-[:Connected_To]->(City)
(Attraction)-[:Near]->(Hotel)
(Activity)-[:Takes_Place_At]->(City)
```

**Indexes:**
```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (n:Entity) REQUIRE n.id IS UNIQUE
```

### 4. Pinecone Configuration

**Index Specs:**
- Dimension: 384
- Metric: Cosine similarity
- Cloud: AWS `us-east-1` (free tier)
- Pods: Serverless (auto-scale)

**Metadata Stored:**
```python
{
  "id": "city_hanoi",
  "name": "Hanoi",
  "type": "City",
  "description": "Capital of Vietnam...",
  "region": "Northern Vietnam",
  "tags": "culture,food,heritage"
}
```

### 5. Gemini Integration

**Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`

**Config:**
- Temperature: 0.3 (factual, low creativity)
- Max tokens: 800 (concise answers)
- Free tier: 1500 requests/day

**Prompt Structure:**
1. System role: "Expert travel assistant"
2. Context: Semantic + Graph + RRF
3. Instructions: 6-step reasoning
4. Output format: Structured with node IDs
