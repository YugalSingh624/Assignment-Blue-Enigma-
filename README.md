For a 3-day romantic beach vacation in Vietnam, I recommend two excellent options, each offering a unique blend of romance and coastal beauty, while keeping the short duration in mind for practical logistics.

---

### Option 1: Ha Long Bay - Romantic Cruise Escape

**Why it's a great choice:** Ha Long Bay (ID: city_ha_long) is renowned for its breathtaking karst landscapes, emerald waters, and unique "beach" experience centered around luxury overnight cruises. It's inherently romantic, offering stunning sunsets, intimate dinners, and a sense of adventure.

**Logistics & Travel Time:**
*   **Location:** Northern Vietnam.
*   **Arrival:** Fly into Hanoi (ID: city_hanoi), then take a 2.5-3 hour shuttle/private transfer to Ha Long Bay.
*   **Consideration:** The travel to and from Ha Long Bay will take up a significant portion of Day 1 and Day 3, making a 2-day/1-night cruise the most practical option for a 3-day trip.

**Recommended Itinerary (3 Days / 2 Nights):**

*   **Day 1: Arrival & Embark on Luxury Cruise**
    *   Morning: Arrive at Hanoi airport (ID: city_hanoi), transfer to Ha Long Bay.
    *   Noon: Board your chosen luxury cruise ship. Enjoy a welcome drink and lunch as you begin sailing through the magnificent limestone karsts.
    *   Afternoon: Participate in activities like kayaking (ID: activity_65 - boat rides) through hidden lagoons, swimming in secluded coves, or visiting a cave.
    *   Evening: Enjoy a romantic sunset dinner on deck, followed by squid fishing or simply stargazing with your partner.
    *   *Accommodation:* Overnight on the cruise ship.

*   **Day 2: Bay Exploration & Romantic Moments**
    *   Morning: Wake up to the serene beauty of the bay. Enjoy Tai Chi on the sundeck, followed by breakfast.
    *   Late Morning: Continue exploring with visits to a floating village or another stunning cave.
    *   Noon: Enjoy an early lunch/brunch on board as the cruise starts its journey back to the harbor.
    *   Afternoon: Disembark and transfer to a romantic hotel in Ha Long City (e.g., Ha Long Bay Hotel 51, if available and suitable for your preferences) for a relaxing evening. Enjoy a couples' spa treatment or a quiet dinner by the bay.
    *   *Accommodation:* Hotel in Ha Long City.

*   **Day 3: Leisure & Departure**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a leisurely breakfast at your hotel. You might have time for a short walk along the beach or visit a local market (ID: activity_68) for souvenirs.
    *   Late Morning: Transfer back to Hanoi airport (ID: city_hanoi) for your departure.

**Why it's romantic:** The stunning scenery, intimate cruise experience, and unique activities like kayaking together create unforgettable romantic memories.   

---

### Option 2: Da Nang & Hoi An - Beach Bliss & Ancient Charm

**Why it's a great choice:** This option combines the beautiful sandy beaches and modern amenities of Da Nang (ID: city_da_nang) with the enchanting, lantern-lit romance of nearby Hoi An (ID: city_hoi_an). It offers a more traditional beach vacation with a strong romantic cultural element.

**Logistics & Travel Time:**
*   **Location:** Central Vietnam.
*   **Arrival:** Fly directly into Da Nang International Airport (DAD). Da Nang's beaches are minutes away, and Hoi An is a short 30-45 minute drive.
*   **Consideration:** Excellent accessibility makes this ideal for a 3-day trip, minimizing travel time between destinations.

**Recommended Itinerary (3 Days / 2 Nights):**

*   **Day 1: Beach Relaxation in Da Nang**
    *   Morning/Noon: Arrive at Da Nang International Airport (ID: city_da_nang). Transfer to your beachfront resort in Da Nang.
    *   Afternoon: Relax on My Khe Beach, one of Vietnam's most beautiful beaches. Enjoy swimming, sunbathing, or a romantic stroll along the shore.
    *   Evening: Indulge in a romantic seafood dinner at a beachfront restaurant in Da Nang.
    *   *Accommodation:* Beachfront resort in Da Nang.

*   **Day 2: Romantic Hoi An Exploration**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a leisurely breakfast at your resort. You might opt for a couples' spa treatment or more beach time.
    *   Afternoon: Take a short taxi or shuttle ride to Hoi An Ancient Town (ID: city_hoi_an). Explore the charming streets, visit ancient houses, and browse the tailor shops.
    *   Late Afternoon: Enjoy a romantic boat ride on the Thu Bon River, especially beautiful as the sun sets and the lanterns begin to glow.
    *   Evening: Have a romantic dinner at one of Hoi An's exquisite riverside restaurants. Release floating lanterns on the river for good luck.
    *   *Accommodation:* Return to your resort in Da Nang or consider an overnight stay in a boutique hotel in Hoi An for a truly immersive experience.

*   **Day 3: Leisure & Departure**
    *   Morning: Enjoy a final leisurely breakfast. Depending on your flight schedule, you could have more beach time, visit the Marble Mountains near Da Nang, or do some last-minute souvenir shopping.
    *   Noon/Afternoon: Transfer to Da Nang International Airport (ID: city_da_nang) for your departure.

**Why it's romantic:** The combination of relaxing beach days, the enchanting atmosphere of Hoi An's lantern-lit streets, and delicious culinary experiences makes this a perfect romantic getaway.

---

Both options offer fantastic romantic beach experiences in Vietnam. Choose Ha Long Bay for a unique cruise adventure amidst stunning natural beauty, or Da Nang/Hoi An for a blend of relaxing sandy beaches and charming cultural romance with easier logistics.

### **Alternative Recommendation: Ha Long Bay (Northern Vietnam)**

If you're looking for a unique "beach" experience that focuses more on stunning natural landscapes and cruising, Ha Long Bay is an excellent romantic choice.   

*   **Why it's a great fit:**
    *   **Beach/Nature:** **Ha Long Bay (ID: city_ha_long)** is famous for its emerald waters and thousands of towering limestone islands topped with rainforests. While traditional sandy beaches are fewer, many cruises offer stops at secluded coves with small beaches or opportunities for kayaking and swimming. The experience is more about the majestic bay itself.
    *   **Romantic:** Overnight cruises on Ha Long Bay are inherently romantic, offering breathtaking sunsets, gourmet meals, and intimate moments amidst unparalleled scenery. The "boat rides" (ID: activity_65) are a core part of this experience.
    *   **Authentic Experiences:** The area offers a blend of nature and local culture.

*   **Suggested 3-Day Itinerary:**

    *   **Day 1: Arrival & Overnight Cruise**
        *   Arrive at Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport (ID: city_hanoi).
        *   Take a pre-arranged transfer (approx. 2.5-3 hours) to Ha Long Bay (ID: city_ha_long).
        *   Board your luxury overnight cruise.
        *   Enjoy a welcome drink and lunch as you sail through the iconic karst landscape.
        *   Participate in activities like kayaking (ID: activity_65) or visiting a floating fishing village.
        *   Enjoy a romantic dinner on board, watching the sunset over the bay.
    *   **Day 2: Bay Exploration & Ha Long City**
        *   Wake up to the serene beauty of the bay. Participate in a Tai Chi session on deck.
        *   Enjoy breakfast and continue cruising, perhaps visiting a stunning cave.
        *   Disembark from your cruise around noon.
        *   Check into a hotel in Ha Long City (e.g., Ha Long Bay Hotel 51).
        *   Spend the afternoon exploring Ha Long City, perhaps visiting a local market (ID: activity_68) or enjoying a historical walk (ID: activity_67).      
        *   Enjoy a romantic dinner with bay views.
    *   **Day 3: Leisure & Departure**
        *   Enjoy a leisurely morning in Ha Long City.
        *   You might opt for a final short boat trip or simply relax.
        *   Transfer back to Hanoi (ID: city_hanoi) for your departure from Noi Bai International Airport.

Both options offer distinct romantic experiences. For a more traditional "beach vacation" with a charming cultural twist, Da Nang and Hoi An are highly recommended. For a unique, scenic, and intimate cruise experience amidst natural wonders, Ha Long Bay is an unforgettable choice.

## 🛠️ Technical Design

### 1. Embedding Strategy

**Choice:** Sentence-Transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

**Rationale:**
- FREE (runs locally)
- Fast (384-dim vectors)
- Good semantic understanding
- No API rate limits

**Performance:**
- 50 embeddings/sec on CPU
- 200 embeddings/sec on GPU
- 150MB model size (cached)

### 2. RRF Fusion Algorithm

**Formula:**
```
score(doc_i) = Σ [1 / (k + rank_vec)] + Σ [1 / (k + rank_graph)]
```

**Parameters:**
- `k = 60` (standard RRF constant)
- Weights: Equal (1.0 each source)

**Why RRF?**
- Source-agnostic (no score normalization needed)
- Robust to outliers
- Used in production (Elasticsearch, Vespa)

### 3. Neo4j Schema

**Node Labels:**
```cypher
(:City {id, name, region, description, tags})
(:Attraction {id, name, type, city, description})
(:Hotel {id, name, stars, price_range, city})
(:Activity {id, name, category, duration, cost})
```

**Relationships:**
```cypher
(City)-[:Located_In]->(Attraction)
(City)-[:Connected_To]->(City)
(Attraction)-[:Near]->(Hotel)
(Activity)-[:Takes_Place_At]->(City)
```

**Indexes:**
```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS 
FOR (n:Entity) REQUIRE n.id IS UNIQUE
```

### 4. Pinecone Configuration

**Index Specs:**
- Dimension: 384
- Metric: Cosine similarity
- Cloud: AWS `us-east-1` (free tier)
- Pods: Serverless (auto-scale)

**Metadata Stored:**
```python
{
  "id": "city_hanoi",
  "name": "Hanoi",
  "type": "City",
  "description": "Capital of Vietnam...",
  "region": "Northern Vietnam",
  "tags": "culture,food,heritage"
}
```

### 5. Gemini Integration

**Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`

**Config:**
- Temperature: 0.3 (factual, low creativity)
- Max tokens: 800 (concise answers)
- Free tier: 1500 requests/day

**Prompt Structure:**
1. System role: "Expert travel assistant"
2. Context: Semantic + Graph + RRF
3. Instructions: 6-step reasoning
4. Output format: Structured with node IDs
